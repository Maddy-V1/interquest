# InterQuest Fixes Summary

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Round 2 Leaderboard Not Showing Approved Users**
**Problem**: Round 2 leaderboard only showed users who completed Round 2, not all approved users.

**Solution**: 
- Updated database views to show **approved users** instead of just completed users
- Created new `round_leaderboard_view` that shows all users with `round2_approved = true`
- Users who haven't completed Round 2 yet show with 0 score but are still listed
- Added status field to distinguish between 'completed' and 'approved' users

### **2. Approved Users Can't Access Round 2 from Home Page**
**Problem**: Users approved for Round 2 were still seeing "not granted permission" message.

**Solution**:
- Fixed `UserService.canAccessRound()` function logic
- **Before**: Checked if user completed previous round + approval
- **After**: Only checks approval status for Round 2 and 3
- Round 1: Always accessible
- Round 2: Only requires `round2_approved = true`
- Round 3: Only requires `round3_approved = true`

## 🔧 **Technical Changes**

### **Database Views Updated** (`database/update_leaderboard_views.sql`)
```sql
-- Round 2 leaderboard now shows ALL approved users
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW round_leaderboard_view AS
SELECT 
    u.id as user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    CONCAT(u.first_name, ' ', u.last_name) as full_name,
    COALESCE(qs.score, 0) as total_score,
    COALESCE(qs.total_questions, 0) as total_questions,
    COALESCE(qs.correct_answers, 0) as correct_answers,
    qs.completed_at,
    CASE 
        WHEN qs.status = 'completed' THEN 'completed'
        ELSE 'approved'
    END as status,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COALESCE(qs.score, 0) DESC, qs.completed_at ASC) as rank
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN quiz_sessions qs ON u.id = qs.user_id AND qs.round_number = 2 AND qs.status = 'completed'
WHERE u.round2_approved = true
ORDER BY COALESCE(qs.score, 0) DESC, qs.completed_at ASC;

-- Added Round 3 leaderboard view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW round3_leaderboard_view AS
-- Similar structure for Round 3 approved users
```

### **Backend API Fixed** (`backend/index.js`)
```javascript
// Added support for Round 3 leaderboard endpoint
app.get('/api/leaderboard/round/:roundNumber', async (req, res) => {
  // Now supports rounds 1, 2, and 3
  let viewName;
  if (roundNumber === '1') {
    viewName = 'overall_leaderboard_view';
  } else if (roundNumber === '2') {
    viewName = 'round_leaderboard_view';
  } else if (roundNumber === '3') {
    viewName = 'round3_leaderboard_view'; // New view
  }
});
```

### **UserService Logic Fixed** (`backend/services/userService.js`)
```javascript
static async canAccessRound(userId, roundNumber) {
  if (roundNumber === 1) {
    return true; // Everyone can access Round 1
  }

  // Get user approval status
  const { data: user } = await supabase
    .from('users')
    .select('round2_approved, round3_approved')
    .eq('id', userId)
    .single()

  // Only check approval status (not previous round completion)
  if (roundNumber === 2) {
    return user.round2_approved === true
  }
  if (roundNumber === 3) {
    return user.round3_approved === true
  }

  return false
}
```

## ✅ **Expected Behavior Now**

### **Admin Dashboard**
1. **Round 1 Leaderboard**: Shows all users who completed Round 1
2. **Round 2 Leaderboard**: Shows all users approved for Round 2 (with scores if completed)
3. **Round 3 Leaderboard**: Shows all users approved for Round 3 (with scores if completed)
4. **Add Button**: Works correctly to approve users from previous round

### **User Home Page**
1. **Round 1**: Always accessible
2. **Round 2**: Accessible if `round2_approved = true` (no longer requires Round 1 completion)
3. **Round 3**: Accessible if `round3_approved = true` (no longer requires Round 2 completion)

### **Leaderboard Display**
1. **Round 1**: All participants who completed Round 1
2. **Round 2**: All approved users (shows 0 score if not completed yet)
3. **Round 3**: All approved users (shows 0 score if not completed yet)

## 🎯 **Workflow Now**
1. User completes Round 1 → appears in Round 1 leaderboard
2. Admin approves user for Round 2 → user appears in Round 2 leaderboard with 0 score
3. User can now access Round 2 from home page
4. User completes Round 2 → their score updates in Round 2 leaderboard
5. Admin approves user for Round 3 → user appears in Round 3 leaderboard with 0 score
6. User can now access Round 3 from home page
7. User completes Round 3 → their score updates in Round 3 leaderboard

The system now correctly shows approved users in leaderboards and allows approved users to access their respective rounds!
