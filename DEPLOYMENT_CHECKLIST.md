### Backend Configuration
- [x] Updated `package.json` build command from echo to `npm install`

- [x] Updated CORS configuration to include production URLs
- [x] Added health check endpoints (`/` and `/health`)
- [x] Added proper error handling middleware
- [x] Enhanced server startup with error handling
- [x] Created `render.yaml` configuration file

### Files Modified/Created
- [x] `backend/package.json` - Fixed build command and added engines
- [x] `backend/index.js` - Updated CORS, added health checks, error handling
- [x] `backend/render.yaml` - Render deployment configuration
- [x] `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Detailed deployment guide

## üöÄ Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Push Changes to Git**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix backend build for Render deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Render**
   - Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
   - Create new Web Service
   - Connect your repository
   - Set root directory to `backend`
   - Use build command: `npm install`
   - Use start command: `npm start`

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=10000
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
   ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin_email
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com
   ```

4. **Test Deployment**
   - Visit your Render URL
   - Should see: `{"message": "InterQuest API Server", "status": "healthy", ...}`
   - Test `/health` endpoint
   - Test API endpoints like `/api/leaderboard`

## üîß Common Issues Fixed

1. **Build Command Error**: Changed from echo statement to actual npm install
2. **CORS Issues**: Added environment variable support for production URLs
3. **Health Checks**: Added proper health check endpoints for Render
4. **Error Handling**: Added middleware to catch and handle errors properly
5. **Port Configuration**: Ensured PORT environment variable is used correctly

## üìù Notes

- The backend is now ready for Render deployment
- Make sure to set all required environment variables in Render
- Update your frontend to use the new backend URL after deployment
- Monitor the deployment logs for any issues
